# to-tui Plugin Marketplace
#
# This file is auto-updated by the release workflow when plugins are tagged.
# When you push a tag like jira-claude-v0.1.0, the release workflow will:
# 1. Build binaries for all platforms
# 2. Create a GitHub release with the artifacts
# 3. Update this file with actual download URLs
# 4. Commit the updated marketplace.toml
#
# Manual entries should only include name, version, and description.
# The downloads section is populated by CI after the first release.
